# AWS Machine Learning Speciality Certification (MLS-C01)

Passed the MLS-C01 certification recently with 941/1000. There is not much detailed info on the exam compared to other popular AWS certifications, so I want to give as detailed information as possible. Everybody who is looking into this certification will have a better idea what he can expect from the exam.

There is no gold standard for preparing for MLS-C01. Compared to other popular certifications there are only very few resources to be used aside from Amazon's official papers and videos (which are very good!)

I made use of free trials on LinuxAcademy and ACloudGuru to go over their MLS-C01 preparation course. Neither of those alone will get you the certification. I'd estimate both courses are overlapping for at least 80% of the topics. Most important takeaway from those two courses: Neither of them will get you the certification. The will give a good overview of topics, but they just scratch the surface and you will need to go much deeper into almost all topics in order to have a shot at passing the certification. Don't be fooled by the practice exams at the end! The questions are not as detailed as the real questions will be.

## What I already knew:

To put everything what I am going to say about the exam into perspective, here is the stuff that I already knew before going after this certification:

- I have been dabbling in Data Engineering/Data Science for a couple years as an autodidact. At the beginning of the year I decided to consolidate my knowledge by participating in a 3-month fulltime Data Science-bootcamp at [neuefische.de](http://neuefische.de) which consolidated and broadend my knowledge. This came in really handy for some questions in the exam.
- Already have Amazon's Cloud Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) under my belt. This also helps for dismissing answers in AWS Services related questions.
- 15+ years experience with various programming languages, database systems, developing patterns and IT best practices.

## What I used as preparation for the exam:

- LinuxAcademy [MLS course](https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty/) (good overview)
- ACloudGuru [MLS course](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty) (good overview)
- AWS SageMaker [Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/index.html) (that's where I spent most of my time)
- Sagemaker DeepDive [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQc8Itd4UTs&list=PLhr1KZpdzukcOr6jzmSrvYnLUtgqsZz)  (very good! shows a lot of dry stuff from the docs in action)
- Bunch of SageMaker presentations from [re:invent](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=re%3Ainvent+2019) (mainly 3xx/4xx)
- AWS Machine Learning [Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/machine-learning/) (imo most of the scenario based questions in the exam are coming from case studies from the blog)

## What I used to test my knowledge:

- Udemy Practice [Exam by Abhishek Singh](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-machine-learning-specialty-full-practice-exams/) (very, very good questions which come pretty close to the style of the real exam questions)
- Udemy Practice [Exam by Frank Kane](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-machine-learning-practice-exam/) (imo a lot weaker (not as close to the exam questions) exam than the one from Singh, still worth the money to find blank spots)
