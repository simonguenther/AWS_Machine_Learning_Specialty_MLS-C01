# AWS Machine Learning Speciality Certification (MLS-C01)

Passed the MLS-C01 certification recently with 941/1000. There is not much detailed info on the exam compared to other popular AWS certifications, so I want to give as detailed information as possible. Everybody who is looking into this certification will have a better idea what he can expect from the exam.

There is no gold standard for preparing for MLS-C01. Compared to other popular certifications there are only very few resources to be used aside from Amazon's official papers and videos (which are very good!)

I made use of free trials on LinuxAcademy and ACloudGuru to go over their MLS-C01 preparation course. Neither of those alone will get you the certification. I'd estimate both courses are overlapping for at least 80% of the topics. Most important takeaway from those two courses: Neither of them will get you the certification. The will give a good overview of topics, but they just scratch the surface and you will need to go much deeper into almost all topics in order to have a shot at passing the certification. Don't be fooled by the practice exams at the end! The questions are not as detailed as the real questions will be.
